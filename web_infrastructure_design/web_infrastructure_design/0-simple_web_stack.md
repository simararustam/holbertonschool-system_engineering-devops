## What is Server:

A server is a hardware device or software that processes requests sent over a network and replies to them. A client is the device that submits a request and waits for a response from the server. The computer system that accepts requests for online files and transmits those files to the client is referred to as a “server” in the context of the Internet.

It provides functionality for clients which are other programs or devices. This architecture is called the client-server model.

## What is the role of the domain name

A domain name is a unique, easy-to-remember address used to access websites, such as 'google.com', and 'facebook.com'. Users can connect to websites using domain names thanks to the DNS system.

## What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com

www is a CNAME (Canonical Name) DNS record-type in www.foobar.com since it also points to the same IP address as foobar.com and if the IP address changes we can only record changes in the DNS A record of foobar.com.

## What is the role of the web server

A web server is a software application that serves content to clients over the World Wide Web. In simpler terms, a web server is the foundation on which websites and web applications are built. A web server operates by receiving requests from clients, such as web browsers, and delivering the requested content in the form of web pages, images, or other multimedia content. It is responsible for managing and storing web pages, databases, and other resources that are required to serve content over the Internet.

## What is the role of the application server

Application servers are pivotal in the architecture of modern software applications, serving as a dynamic conduit between the user interface and backend databases. These servers are not only responsible for executing application logic but also enhance the overall efficiency and management of complex applications. 

## What is the role of the database

It is used to store user information, session data, and other application data. The database is the central repository for all of this data. Web applications use a variety of databases to store data such as flat files, relational databases, object-relational databases, and NoSQL databases.

## What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website

A web server communicates with a web browser using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). ... While web servers typically host websites that are accessible on the Internet, they can also be used to communicate between web clients and servers in local area networks such as a company's intranet.

## SPOF

A single point of failure (SPOF) is a potential risk posed by a flaw in the design, implementation or configuration of a circuit or system. SPOF refers to one fault or malfunction that can cause an entire system to stop operating.

## Downtime During Maintenance

"Downtime" in IT refers to periods when a system is unavailable. Maintenance downtime occurs when a machine is non-operational due to required maintenance work. Planning and managing maintenance activities are essential to minimize the impact of downtime on system operations.

## Scalability Challenges with High Traffic

The ability to scale infrastructure is crucial to accommodate increased website traffic. Without proper scalability measures, websites may experience performance issues or crashes during peak traffic, leading to lost visitors and revenue. Implementing scalability ensures website responsiveness and reliability even under heavy traffic, preserving performance and user experience.
